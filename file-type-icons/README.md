# file-type-icons
This folder contains the icons that are displayed next to datasets in ckan to show the type of dataset (image/csv/...).

They were originally created by [smth](https://github.com/smth) and published in [his repository](https://github.com/mintcanary/file-types).

The icon for the `image` type was later added by [hknochi](https://github.com/hknochi) with [this pull request](https://github.com/ckan/ckan/pull/2948).

As per `LICENSE.txt` the assets are licensed under CC0.
